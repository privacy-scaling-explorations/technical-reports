# PSE Technical Reports Repository

## Overview

This repository hosts the Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) Technical Reports, a collection of research papers, proof-of-concept projects, and technical documents generated from projects funded by the PSE team at the Ethereum Foundation. The aim is to contribute valuable insights and advancements to the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Motivation and Reasoning

The creation of this repository stems from our commitment to the open dissemination of knowledge and the responsible use of grant funds. We believe that the research we fund should not only advance the field but also be accessible to the community at large. By standardizing and publishing these reports, we aim to create a lasting impact, allowing for greater dissemination, scrutiny, and utility of the work we support. This repository serves as a centralized platform for sharing these contributions, fostering innovation, and encouraging collaboration within the Ethereum ecosystem.
